Project Overview
The project focuses on leveraging a dataset related to electric vehicles to derive actionable insights. It involves analyzing key performance indicators such as total vehicles, average electric range, the proportion of BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles), and PHEVs (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles). Visualizations like line charts, bar charts, and maps are used to assess market trends, growth patterns, and regional adoption rates.

Objective
Enhance Decision-Making: Provide a comprehensive understanding of the electric vehicle landscape, including technological advancements and market share.
Drive Adoption: Identify patterns and trends that can help stakeholders promote EV adoption effectively and plan for future growth.




The project provided hands-on experience in analyzing electric vehicle datasets, creating insightful visualizations, and interpreting market trends to derive actionable business insights. It also enhanced skills in data-driven decision-making and storytelling through charts.
